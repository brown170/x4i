The EXFOR Interface (x4i) software package is a project that is funded by the DOE Office of Science.
We have just completed a version 1.0 of x4i, and per our sponsor's request, would like to release it 
as an open source package.  Users at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory
and the International Atomic Energy Agency have expressed interested in using our software.  X4i is 
being integrated into our next generation Nuclear and Atomic Data System webapplication. Our sponsor 
would like distribution of the software by the end of FY11.

The information that we are distributing includes the source code for x4i, the complete EXFOR 
data library (as of 12/2010) and a database indexing the EXFOR datasets.
