TITLE      -THE DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION FOR NEUTRON-PROTON
            SCATTERING AT 14.5 MEV.
FACILITY   .SAMES ACCELERATOR OF NPL.
INC-SOURCE (D-T  ) A 150 KEV DEUTERON BEAM OF UP TO 5 MICROAMPS,
            COLLIMATED TO 8 MM DIAMETER, WAS DIRECTED ONTO A SOLID
            TI-T TARGET, 4 CI, 1 MG/CM2. THE TITANIUM WAS EVAPORA-
            TED ON A PURE ALUMINUM BACKING, 0.5 MM THICK AND 4.1
            CM DIAMETER. THE TARGET WAS INCLINED 45 DEGREES WITH
            RESPECT TO THE BEAM, AND WAS COOLED WITH A JET OF AIR.
METHOD     (ASSOP) THE NEUTRON FLUENCE WAS DETERMINED WITH THE
            ASSOCIATED PARTICLE TECHNIQUES, BY DETECTING THE ALPHA
            PARTICLES.
           (COINC) A PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE WAS USED TO DETERMINE
            THE N-P SCATTERING CROSS SECTIONS.
MONITOR    . ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS
DETECTOR   (SOLST) THE ASSOCIATED ALPHA PARTICLES WERE DETECTED
            WITH A SILICON DETECTOR, HAVING A 4 MM DIAMETER APER-
            TURE, MOUNTED ABOUT 1 M FROM THE TARGET, AND AT AN
            ANGLE OF 90 DEGREES WITH RESPECT TO THE BEAM.
           (LONGC) IN ADDITION, A LONGCOUNTER, SITUATED AT 5 M
            FROM THE TARGET, WAS USED TO MONITOR THE FLUX STABILI-
            TY AND TARGET QUALITY.
           (TELES,SOLST,PROPC) THE PROTON RECOIL TELESCOPE HAD A
            24.322 MG/CM2 CH2 RADIATOR, 1.125 CM IN RADIUS, AND
            CONTAINING 2.088E+21 ATOMS OF HYDROGEN/CM2. THE DETEC-
            TOR APERTURE HAD A RADIUS OF 0.75015 CM, AND WAS SITU-
            ATED 12.666 CM FROM THE RADIATOR. THE DETECTOR SYSTEM
            CONSISTED OF PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS AND A SILICON SAND-
            WICH DETECTOR. THE PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS WERE OPERATED
            WITH A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF 95 PER-CENT AR AND 5 PER-
            CENT CO2 GAS AT PRESSURES OF 760 AND 400 TORR FOR THE
            0 AND 35 DEGREE MEASUREMENTS. THE SILICON SANDWICH DE-
            TECTOR CONSISTED OF TWO FULLY DEPLETED SURFACE BARRIER
            DELTA-E DETECTORS, 100 AND 250 MICROMETERS THICK,
            WORKING IN COINCIDENCE MODE. THE TELESCOPE WAS POSI-
            TIONED NORMAL TO THE TARGET AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 20
            CM, AND COULD BE ROTATED AROUND A VERTICAL AXIS
            THROUGH THE RADIATOR, FOR MEASUREMENTS AT DIFFERENT
            ANGLES. 10 MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE AT EACH OF 0 AND
            +/- 35 DEGREES SCATTERING ANGLE.
CORRECTION .CORRECTIONS WERE MADE FOR DEAD-TIME LOSSES IN THE AL-
            PHA COUNTING, BACKGROUND FROM CARBON IN THE RADIATOR,
            TARGET-SCATTERED NEUTRONS, PROTONS SCATTERED IN THE
            PRT APERTURE, PROTON REACTIONS IN SILICON, AND DEAD-
            TIME IN THE PRT ELECTRONICS. THE CALCULATED PRT EFFI-
            CIENCY WAS CONSIDERED TO BE EXACT.
