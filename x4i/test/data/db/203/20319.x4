TITLE      -ON THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF 3.1 MEV NEUTRONS
            SCATTERED BY PROTONS-
FACILITY   (CCW  )    COCKCROFT-WALTON ACCELERATOR.
INC-SOURCE (D-D  )    HEAVY WATER ICE TARGET.
SAMPLE     .PARAFFIN, WATER, RING SCATTERERS.
DETECTOR   (PROPC)    IONIZATION CHAMBER FILLED WITH METHANE.
ANALYSIS   .CROSS-SECTIONS OBTAINED BY SUBTRACTING THE
            CONTRIBUTION OF CARBON AND OXYGEN FROM THE CROSS-
            SECTIONS OF PARAFFIN AND WATER RESPECTIVELY.
MONITOR    .THE ASSUMPTION WAS MADE THAT THE IONIZATION
            CURRENT IN THE IONIZATION CHAMBER PRODUCED
            BY NEUTRONS WHICH LOST THEIR ENERGY THROUGH
            THE COLLISION WITH PROTONS, WAS PROPORTIONAL
            TO THE PRODUCT OF THE ENERGY AFTER COLLISION
            AND THE TOTAL SCATTERING CROSS SECTION OF
            NEUTRONS AT THAT ENERGY. THE TOTAL
            SCATTERING CROSS  SECTION = 2.224 +- 0.113
