TITLE      Differential Cross Sections for Small Angle Scattering
            of 24-MeV Neutrons by Protons
FACILITY   (ACCEL) Tandem accelerator.
INC-SOURCE (D-T) 7.0 MeV deuterons were incident on a tritium gas
            cell.
SAMPLE     Liquid hydrocarbon scintillator, 2.5cm diam. x 2.5-cm
            high, wrapped in aluminum foil and mounted on RCA 8575
            phototube. Total number of hydrogen atoms in sample
            (0.659 +- 0.003)10**24.
METHOD     Both count rate of neutrons scattered by the target
            and of neutrons of the zero degree incident beam were
            measured. The ratio of these two count rates gives
            the differential cross section and is independent of
            incident neutron flux. The cross section depends only
            on the ratio of the detector efficiencies at nearby
            energies.
           Open shadow bar shielding only.
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 2.5-cm. diam. x 5.1-cm. high liquid scintillator
            mounted on AMPEREX XP1021 photomultiplier tube.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for:
            . multiple scattering,
            . finite geometry,
            . attenuation in detector, target and air,
            . wall effects.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Data uncertainty of approximately 1.5%, due
            principally to uncertainties in exponential
            attenuation, multiple scattering, and bias factors.
STATUS     (APRVD) Approved by author.
