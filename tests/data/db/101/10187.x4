TITLE      Neutron-proton elastic scattering from 5 to 30 GeV/c
FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Brookhaven AGS.
INC-SOURCE (P-BE) 29.4 GeV/c protons incident on beryllium target.
SAMPLE     Liquid hydrogen target flask was made of .025 cm mylar,
            length = 30.5 cm, dia.= 6.35 cm.
METHOD     Angles of the proton and neutron and proton momentum
            were measured and used as inputs for a fitting
            program, which included error estimates on the
            measured quantities.
DETECTOR   (TRD) Scattered neutrons were detected in a thick
            plate spark-chamber array while the recoil protons
            were detected and momentum analyzed in a magnetic
            spectrometer with thin foil spark chambers.
           Neutron beam was 15 mrad with respect to primary proton
            beam. The distance from the internal Be target to
            liquid hydrogen sample was 49.2 m. The defining
            collimator was 2.54 cm in diameter and was located
            34.7 m from internal Be target.
PART-DET   (N,P) Both scattered neutrons and recoil protons were
            detected
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,TOT),,SIG)
           Normalized by fitting
            to the zero degree point determined from the optical
            theorem and existing data on the real part of the
            forward scattering amplitude. The value of the total
            neutron-proton cross section used was 38 mb. A linear
            variation was assumed in the ratio of the real to the
            imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, with
            a value -0.33 near 20 GeV/c and -.45 near 5 GeV/c.
CORRECTION Corrections were made for proton energy loss as it
            passed through sample, for inelastics, and for target-
            empty events.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) A Monte Carlo study indicated that the
            uncertainty in the momentum transfer was essentially
            independent of the momentum transfer and of the
            incident momentum, remaining constant at +/- 0.017
            (GeV/c)**2.
