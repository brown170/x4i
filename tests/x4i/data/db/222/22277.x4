TITLE      -THE PI-NN COUPLING FROM HIGH PRECISION NP CHARGE
            EXCHANGE AT 162 MEV.
FACILITY   (CYCLO)  THE GUSTAF WERNER CYCLOTRON AT THE SVEDBERG
            LABORATORY, UPPSALA UNIVERSITY, WAS USED.
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) A PROTON BEAM OF 162 MEV IMPINGED ON A 427
            MG/CM2 THICK LITHIUM TARGET, ENRICHED TO 99.98 PER-
            CENT IN 7-LI. THE UNAFFECTED PROTON BEAM WAS BENT BY
            A MAGNET INTO A WELL-SHIELDED BEAM DUMP, WHILE THE
            NEUTRONS WERE COLLIMATED IN A NARROW CONE AT 0 DEGREES
            BY A HEAVY COLLIMATOR SYSTEM, BEFORE ENTERING THE EX-
            PERIMENTAL AREA ABOUT 8 M AFTER THE PRODUCTION TARGET.
            THE NEUTRON BEAM SPOT AT THE IRRADIATION POSITION HAD
            A DIAMETER OF 7 CM.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRONS SHOWED A SEMI-MONOENERGETIC NEUTRON SPEC-
            TRUM, WITH A FULL ENERGY PEAK AND A LOW-ENERGY TAIL.
            THE LATTER WAS SUPRESSED BY TOF TECHNIQUES.
SAMPLE     .FOUR 100 MG/CM2 THICK CH2 TARGETS WERE MOUNTED IN A
            MULTITARGET SYSTEM WITH MULTIWIRE PROPORTIONAL
            CHAMBERS BETWEEN THE TARGETS. IN THIS WAY THE ENERGY
            LOSS IN THE SUBSEQUENT TARGETS COULD BE CORRECTED FOR.
            FOR ANGLES LARGER THAN 15 DEGREES, PROTONS FROM REAC-
            TIONS ON CARBON IN THE TARGET CHAMBER FOILS CAN INTER-
            FERE, AND TWO 185 MG/CM2 12-C TARGET WAS USED TO
            CORRECT FOR THAT.
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) THE RECOIL PROTONS WERE DETECTED BY A MAGNETIC
            SPECTROGRAPH, EQUIPPED WITH FOUR POSITION-SENSITIVE
            DRIFT CHAMBERS AND THREE TRIGGER SCINTILLATORS. THE
            PROTON ENERGY AND EMISSION ANGLE WAS DETERMINED BY
            RAY-TRACING THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FIELD.

ANALYSIS   (INTAD) GAUSSIANS WERE FITTED TO THE PROTON PEAK FOR
            EACH ANGULAR BIN. SINCE THE DATA ONLY SPAN A PART OF
            THE FULL ANGULAR RANGE, IT WAS EXTRAPOLATED BY USING
            THE VZ40 SOLUTION OF THE ARNDT ET AL PHASE-SHIFT ANA-
            LYSIS. IN THIS WAY THE DIFFERENTIAL DATA COULD BE
            INTEGRATED AND NORMALIZED TO THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,TOT),,SIG) VALUE FROM LISOWSKI. IN ADDITION
            TO THE STATISTICAL ERROR GIVEN, THERE IS A 1 PERCENT
            SYSTEMATIC ERROR.
CORRECTION .THE DATA WERE CORRECTED FOR BACKGROUND AND FOR ACCEP-
            TANCE EFFECTS.
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) THE ERRORS GIVEN ARE MAINLY STATISTICAL AND
            ORIGINATE FROM COUNTING STATISTICS, THE PEAK-FITTING
            PROCEDURE AND 12-C BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION. IN ADDI-
            TION, THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC CROSS SECTION SCALE UN-
            CERTAINTY OF 4 PER-CENT.
